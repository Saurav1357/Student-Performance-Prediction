# Student-Performance-Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts students' final grades using feature selection techniques and visual insights via Power BI.

# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts students' final grades based on various academic and personal features.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project was created to explore and apply various **dimensionality reduction techniques** and **machine learning models** for predicting student performance. It also includes a **Power BI report** for visual exploratory analysis.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Practiced

- ðŸ“‰ **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**
  - Low Variance Filter
  - Multicollinearity Check
  - Random Forest Feature Importance
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Investigated how different variables affect student grades
  - Visualized key insights using graphs and heatmaps

- ðŸ“ˆ **Business Intelligence (BI)**
  - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze trends and answer self-posed questions

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI (for data visualization and reporting)
- Spyder IDE (preferred for its Variable Explorer and clear data view)

## ðŸ§° Why Spyder?

While Jupyter Notebook is a great tool, **Spyder** was chosen because of its powerful **Variable Explorer**, which made working with data more intuitive without relying on repeated `print()` statements.
